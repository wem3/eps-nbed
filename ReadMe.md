# ReadMe.md: supposed to be an overview of the repository 
---  
Reading git history? Good on ya!  In this instance, however, it is a mistake.

## Blame it on the weather:  

I nuked the original ReadMe.md and move it to `meeting-001-overview.md`.  

Once there is more content in the repo, I'll update this to explain the directory structure, etc.  

I'm sure there is a better way of storing mutual notes, and git is overly technical for text that is strictly human-readable, but it doesn't cost anything and never lets me down.
