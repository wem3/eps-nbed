#Neurofeedback: resources & relevant articles  
---  

To me, neurofeedback is anything that takes an electrical signal from the brain, presents a perceptual signal to the same person whose brain produced the electrical signal, records a new neural signal, and adjusts the stimulus accordingly.  [Wikipedia's EEG article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) is awesome, the [Neurofeedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofeedback) one, not so much.  

There is some encouraging evidence for using neurofeedback to treat ADHD and MDD, but it's early days.  My hunch would be that it's far more effective for ADHD than MDD (or any other disorder, really), because whether or not the neural signal component is robust, practicing a task that requires sustained attention is bound to have *some* impact on disordered attention.  

## Neurofeedback Articles:
---  

[Neurofeedback training for executive function in ADHD children: a systematic review and meta-analysis][1] just dropped in August.  The authors found that 20+ hours of neurofeedback training (NFT) improved performance on measures of inhibitory control and working memory.  Their methods were crap (don't meta-analyze 17 studies.  You can just re-analyze the raw data), but it just dropped in August, and there's something to be said for living on the bleeding edge.  

[Neurofeedback for cognitive enhancement and intervention and brain plasticity][2] is a pretty handy review, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

[Neurofeedback: a comprehensive review on system design, methodology, and clinical applications][3] gets cited all the time, but the authors really lose me with Table 1.  The authors are clinicians, though, and it's probably good to have read the one article that I'm pretty confident anyone on a regulatory board might be familiar with.  Be wary of taking seriously anythin they have to say about the various frequency bands.

## Relevant Neuroscience:

These articles aren't all about neurofeedback, per se, but are worth reading.  

[Low resolution electromagnetic tomography: a new method for localizing electrical activity in the brain][4] is a paper about which my feelings are profoundly mixed. LORETA is a cool way of extracting the drop of signal from an ocean of noise, but it also lends itself to smoke and mirrors.
