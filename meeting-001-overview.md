## Resources:  

"For the basic sciences, Wikipedia is a much better resource than any textbook, primer, or manual.  Who do you think writes the textbooks?  The people who don't have to write this for free instead."
*Bill Roberts*  

I know you've got some electrical engineering background.  Mine is a little more autodidactic, ad hoc, and/or delusional.  That said, please don't take offense.  I used Wikipedia to learn electricity, defend TMS to the UO IRB, and find out where to get more down and dirty resources to teach myself tDCS.  

### EEG
The way I understand [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography), it essentially reflects cortical activity, it's just extremely noisy.  

I think a wearable with two or maybe four electrodes would be way more manageable if we were gonna teach people how to teach themselves what may be reading real neural signal or may be reading tea leaves.  

However, the reason some of my cog neuro associates aren't crazy about it is, in some ways, precisely because of what we're trying to do (except we're not trying to contribute a brick to the temple of science): there's a low enough barrier to entry that anyone can do it, and most people do it wrong.  

Same is true of fMRI, but a little higher financial and institutional barrier to entry?  

[OpenEEG](https://openeeg.sourceforge.net/) is about building your own rig for $200 - $400.  I'm sure @machinehum, the dude from [Rootkit Labs](who was inspired recently by this Reddit post about an [open source 16-channel BCI board](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/1nq15ei/open_source_16_channels_bci_board_i_made_called/?share_id=_aLrXmkW9J9qam_2bXZt_&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) [(github)](https://github.com/nikki-uwu/Meower) can probably make it better, cheaper.
  

He also recommended checking out [OpenBCI](https://openbci.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=716348300&utm_content=openbci&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1_SkBhDwARIsANbGpFthlEp6Iq1jgCN5xBfwNZeFPKy5xRB0vbkTdBDleIc1IHU6DhBt-voaAnx-EALw_wcB)  

All of this said, it's pretty messy.  I think we need to play around and see what kind of signals we can reliably get from ourselves and what, if anything, we can do with em'.  

### Neurofeedback  

Need not necessarily depend on EEG, but I think that's how most people do it. 

[Neurofeedback: A Comprehensive Review on System Design, Methodology and Clinical Applications](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4892319/) must have been SEO spammed to hell and back or something, because it strikes me as really silly about EEG spectra and fundamental neuroscience, but it is cited like a motherfucker.

### Neural Stimulation:
[TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation) is "non-invasive," but I don't think so necessarily.  It's certainly more invasive than [tDCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation).  Effect sizes are much smaller, though.  tACS may have potential?  I guess the line is if the magnetic pulse is strong enough to penetrate the skull?  

rTMS I think is totally safe.  Theta-burst (or other oscillitory induction programs) may be the key to unlocking the human brain's full potential, or may be the road to perdition.  

We wouldn't need high-frequency single-shot except for calibration.
